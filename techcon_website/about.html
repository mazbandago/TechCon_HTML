            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p>Before the modern-day computer ever existed, there were precursors that helped people achieve complex task.</p>
            <p>The abacus is the earliest known calculating tool, in use since 2400 B.C.E. and still used in part of the world today. An abacus consist of rows of movable beads on a rod that represent numbers.</p>
            <p>But it wasn't until the 1800s that the idea of programming devices really came along. At this time the Jacquard loom was developed, enabling looms to produce fabrics with intricate woven patterns. This system used punched cards that were fed into the loom to control weaving patterns. Computers well into the 20th century used the loom's system of automatically issuing machine instructions. But electronic devices eventually replaceed this method.</p>
